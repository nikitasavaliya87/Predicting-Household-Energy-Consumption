# Predicting-Household-Energy-Consumption
MSc dissertation
# Abstract
Residential energy consumption has garnered significant attention in the field of urban energy management, driven by the growing interest in data-driven machine learning algorithms that leverage consumption data for predicting energy usage trends. This research extensively compares various machine learning algorithms using the Kaggle dataset of Household Electric Power Consumption, with the overarching goal of identifying the most effective, predictive, and efficient algorithm. The study takes a comprehensive approach by analyzing both regression and classification tasks on a shared dataset, evaluating models such as linear regression, decision trees, lasso regression, ridge regression, random forest, and XGBoost for regression, and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, and XGBoost for classification. XGBoost emerges as the best classification model for accuracy, while linear regression excels in regression based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score. K-Nearest Neighbors and Ridge Regression stand out in computational analysis for classification and regression, respectively. Moreover, the research incorporates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques like SHAP values to unveil significant features driving linear regression and XGBoost models. This multifaceted approach underscores the holistic nature of model selection, encompassing performance benchmarks, computational intricacies, and interpretability, reinforcing the overall robustness of the study.

# Model Implementation
The research in this investigation employs a structured approach that encompasses both regression and classification analyses. The primary objective is to accurately estimate "Active Energy Consumption (G_ActivePower)" by leveraging various machine learning techniques, including Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. This dual analytical strategy optimizes energy forecasts by classifying energy patterns into "Low," "Medium," or "High" categories and making numerical energy consumption predictions. The next steps involve carefully selecting the best models for both classification and regression tasks, saving them as 'cls_model.pkl' and 'reg_model.pkl,' and implementing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to extract vital factors influencing the models' forecasting accuracy. This approach not only elucidates the variables affecting classification and regression outcomes but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insights for future decision-making and improvement processes.
